      <h2>About</h2>
    
      <p>In 1986 Hugh Merton was abducted by aliens in rural New Brunswick after years of psychic rumination. Through the use of several techniques Hugh was able to create his own pathway for contact. </p>

<p>This website is dedicated to the knowledges of extraterrestrial life and their advanced technologies gained by Hugh Merton during his practice of psychic rumination from 1981 - 2017. Throughout his life, Hugh has remained dedicated to his pursuit of psychic ruminations and extraterrestrial communication. He has been featured in numerous media outlets, both locally and nationally, where he shares his story and the methods he uses to connect with aliens. He is also known to host workshops and speak at events, where he guides others on how to tap into their own psychic abilities. </p>

        <h3>1. Relaxation</h3>
        Psychic rumination requires a deep level of relaxation in order to be effective. This can be achieved through cubic breathing, also known as "four-square breathing". This is a meditative technique that is used to set ones mind and begin the production of Alpha waves (8-12 hz). The technique involves inhaling for a count of four, holding the breath for a count of four, exhaling for a count of four, and then holding the breath again for a count of four. This process is repeated for several minutes, allowing the individual to focus on their breath and release any tension or stress. 
        <h3>2. Intention </h3>
        This involves setting a clear intention or goal for the rumination, such as seeking a specific knowledge or information. This intention should be unambiguous, in order to achieve the desired outcome. Instead of having a general intention like "I want to communicate with aliens," try to be more specific such as "I want to receive information about alien methods of mathematics”. It is also important to be use positive language when setting your intention.  
 <h3>3. Energy Alignment </h3>
       This involves aligning your energy with the energy of the extraterrestrial beings, so that communication is more easily established. This facet is the most difficult for beginners. In order to successfully align your energy, it's important to work on developing your intuition and sensitivity to energy. A powerful technique for this purpose is sensory deprivation, more about this is explained below. Its also important to cultivate a strong sense of trust and belief in your ability to connect with extraterrestrial beings through psychic rumination.
 <h3>4. Receptivity </h3>
	opening ones self to be receptive to the knowledges received is very important. This involves opening your mind and being receptive to any messages or communication that may come through. This is a passive state of being, where you allow the information to come to you, rather than trying to actively seek it out.

The Ganzfeld experiment in parapsychology was inspired by the work of German psychologist Wolfgang Metzger, who first demonstrated the perceptual distortions that can occur when a person is presented with a homogeneous visual field. In the 1970s, Charles Honorton at the Maimonides Medical Center sought to study the connection between ESP and dreams by exposing subjects to sensory deprivation in the Ganzfeld state, with the hypothesis that this would enhance "psi-conductive states" and improve the transmission of "psi-mediated information". The first full Ganzfeld experiment was published by Honorton and Sharon Harper in 1974, and since then, Ganzfeld experiments have been a staple in parapsychological research.</p>
The Procedure: A straight-forward technique that will improve you sensitivy to energy. You will need a ping pong ball, a lamp with a red light bulb, a radio, an exacto knife, some tape and a dark and quiet room in which to practice. start by cutting the ping pong ball in half with the knife. Once this is finished tape the ping pong ball halves over your eyes and turn on the red light and set the radio in bewtween stations in order to produce white noise. It is best to lay back in a chair or on a bed while you do this. Your entire field of vision should be nothing but a wash of red light.</p>

<p> In this state your brain/mind will need to fill the sensory void and begin to look to the spirit for information. Most recall hearing, seeing and feeling things that are not physically there while practicing this technique. In time the access of your brain and mind to the spiritual information around you will strengthen your sensitivity to energies when not deprived, allowing you to differentiate between hertz frequencies more easily. </p>

     <p>Hugh Merton’s greatest breakthrough with psychic rumination was his discovery of the base four counting system used by extraterrestials to count with their fingers up to 256. </p>

     <p>Hugh is currently writing a book about the base four counting system and how it is employed in alien navigation systems. As well as other knowledges he has obtained through rumination/abductions.</p>
